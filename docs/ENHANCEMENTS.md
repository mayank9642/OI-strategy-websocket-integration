### 1A. Fixed Strike Price Extraction Bug (June 2025)
- Fixed a critical bug that was preventing the strategy from correctly parsing strike prices
- The error "Could not parse strike price from symbol" was resolved
- Implemented a robust regular expression pattern that reliably extracts the 5-digit strike price: `match = re.search(r'(\d{5})[CP]E$', symbol)`

### 2. Enhanced Market Hour Checks
- Added thorough checks for market open/close times
- Added weekend detection
- Added simple holiday detection
- Improved time-based logic for 9:20 AM analysis

- Streamlined trade execution process
- Added paper trade flag in trade history

### 4. Improved Trade Management

- Added detailed P&L calculation for trades
- Created comprehensive trade history logging
- Fixed strike price extraction from symbols

### 5. Added Performance Tracking & Reporting
- Created daily summary reports

- Stored historical trade data

### 6. Created Web Dashboard
- Built interactive Dash application for monitoring
- Added real-time P&L chart
- Added trade history table
- Created daily statistics display
- Created convenience scripts to launch dashboard

### 7. Advanced Risk Management (June 2025)
- Added trailing stop loss that dynamically adjusts as trades move in favorable direction
- Configured via `use_trailing_stop`, `trailing_stop_pct`, and `trailing_trigger_pct` 
- Helps lock in profits while still allowing for maximum upside potential

### 8. Single Trade Per Day Limit (June 2025)
- Implemented a daily trade limit of one trade per day
- Uses the `trade_taken_today` flag to enforce this limit
- Trade flag resets at midnight, ensuring fresh trading opportunities each day

### 9. Real-Time P&L Monitoring (June 2025)
- Added second-by-second position updates after trade entry
- Continually displays entry price, current price, stop loss level, trailing stop, and P&L
- Implemented through a background thread for non-blocking operation

### 10. Trade Logging to Excel (June 2025)
- Added comprehensive Excel-based trade logs with professional formatting
- Each day gets its own Excel file with date stamp in the filename
- Includes columns for all relevant trade data: Entry/Exit DateTime, Symbol, Direction, Prices, Stop Loss, Target, P&L, etc.
- Enables better trade analysis and reporting capabilities

### 11. Strike Selection Filtering (June 2025)
- Added filters to avoid selecting strikes that are too far from current price
- Implemented `max_strike_distance` parameter (default: 500 points) to limit distance from ATM
- Increased minimum premium threshold to 50.0 (from default 3.0)
- Added sophisticated strike selection algorithm:
  1. First checks highest OI strikes from current expiry
  2. If premium < threshold, checks 2nd highest OI strikes
  3. If still below threshold, tries next expiry's highest OI strikes
  4. If still below threshold, tries 2nd highest OI from next expiry
- Ensures system always prioritizes highest OI (core strategy) while maintaining practical premium levels
- Logs detailed information about strike selection process and which criteria were used
- Prevents system from selecting deep OTM options with very low premiums
- Logs distance of selected strikes from current spot price for better decision-making

### 13. Performance Tracking System (June 2025)
- Added comprehensive trade tracking with detailed metrics for each trade
- Records statistics to `logs/trade_performance.csv` for future analysis
- Calculates win rate, average win/loss, and trade expectancy

### 14. Daily Trade Limit (June 2025)
- Added strict enforcement of one trade per day
- Prevents re-entry after a trade is closed to avoid overtrading
- Strategy will skip breakout monitoring after the daily limit is reached
- Logs clear messages when the daily limit is reached
- Trade limit resets at the beginning of each trading day

### 15. Real-Time Position Monitoring (June 2025)
- Added second-by-second position updates in active trades
- Displays entry price, current price, stoploss level, and P&L in real-time
- Uses a dedicated monitoring thread for continuous updates
- Provides clearer and more consistent trade status information
- Makes it easier to track position performance throughout the trade duration

## How to Use

### Running the Strategy
1. Run authentication: `.\run_auth.ps1` or `run_auth.bat`
2. Run the main strategy: `python src\main.py`

### Viewing Performance Dashboard
1. Run the dashboard: `.\run_dashboard.ps1` or `run_dashboard.bat`
2. Open your browser to: http://localhost:8050

- Added ability to simulate strategy across multiple time points in a day
- Created realistic option chain data generation with proper volatility and OI characteristics

### 2. Historical Data & Backtesting
