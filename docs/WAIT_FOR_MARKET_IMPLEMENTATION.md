# Wait For Market Open Implementation - Change Log

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `wait_for_market_open()` Method in `strategy.py`
- Added a 10-second sleep between market open checks
- Added code to automatically run the strategy once the market opens
- Fixed indentation issues that were causing syntax errors

### 2. Enhanced `run_fixed_strategy.py`
- Improved comments to clarify that waiting for market open automatically runs the strategy

### 3. Enhanced `wait_and_run_strategy.py`
- Captured the return value of the `wait_for_market_open()` method
- Fixed indentation and formatting

### 4. Created Helper Scripts
- Created `wait_for_market_open.bat` for Windows command prompt
- Created `wait_for_market_open.ps1` for PowerShell

### 5. Updated Documentation
- Added a new section in README.md about the wait for market open functionality
- Added examples of how to run the waiting variant of the strategy

## Benefits of Implementation

1. **Continuous Operation**: Strategy now waits for market open instead of exiting when market is not open
2. **Better User Experience**: No need to manually restart the strategy when market opens
3. **Accurate Timing**: Starts trading exactly when market opens for optimal strategy implementation
4. **Multiple Access Options**: Can be run via batch file, PowerShell, or Python directly

## How It Works

The implementation uses a loop that:
1. Checks if market is open (9:15 AM IST)
2. If market is open, runs the strategy with force_analysis=True
3. If market is not open, sleeps for 10 seconds then checks again
4. Provides informative logs about time remaining until market opens

## Usage Instructions

To run the strategy with automatic waiting for market open:

```bash
# Windows Command Prompt
wait_for_market_open.bat

# PowerShell
./wait_for_market_open.ps1

# Directly with Python
python wait_and_run_strategy.py
```
