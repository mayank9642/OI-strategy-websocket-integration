## WebSocket Price Updates - Fixed Implementation

### Issues Fixed

1. **Unicode Encoding Issue**
   - Modified the code to use "UP" and "DOWN" instead of Unicode arrows (↑/↓) that couldn't be displayed correctly in the Windows console
   - Updated both `verify_realtime_price_updates.py` and `test_improved_websocket.py` to use text indicators

2. **Enhanced WebSocket Integration**
   - Created a new runner script that uses the improved websocket implementation with the main strategy
   - Added proper run scripts (both batch and PowerShell) for running the fixed verification tests

### Files Modified

1. `verify_realtime_price_updates.py` - Fixed Unicode arrows to use "UP"/"DOWN" text
2. `test_improved_websocket.py` - Fixed Unicode arrows to use "UP"/"DOWN" text
3. Created new files:
   - `run_fixed_price_update_verification.bat`
   - `run_fixed_price_update_verification.ps1`
   - `run_improved_websocket_test_fixed.bat`
   - `run_improved_websocket_test_fixed.ps1`
   - `run_strategy_with_improved_websocket.py`
   - `run_strategy_with_improved_websocket.bat`
   - `run_strategy_with_improved_websocket.ps1`

### How to Use

1. To verify real-time price updates:
   ```
   run_fixed_price_update_verification.bat
   ```
   or
   ```
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File run_fixed_price_update_verification.ps1
   ```

2. To run the improved websocket test:
   ```
   run_improved_websocket_test_fixed.bat
   ```
   or
   ```
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File run_improved_websocket_test_fixed.ps1
   ```

3. To run the strategy with the improved websocket:
   ```
   run_strategy_with_improved_websocket.bat
   ```
   or
   ```
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File run_strategy_with_improved_websocket.ps1
   ```

### Verification Results

The verification tests confirmed that real-time price updates ARE working correctly. The issue was simply with the display of Unicode arrows in the Windows console. The actual websocket functionality is properly receiving and processing price updates.

When you run these tests, you should see price updates for NIFTY50-INDEX with proper "UP" and "DOWN" indicators instead of the Unicode arrows that were causing display issues.
