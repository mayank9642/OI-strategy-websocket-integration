# WebSocket Data Management Solution

## Problem
The unsubscribe method in the WebSocket API was not working properly, which caused LTP (Last Traded Price) mixups between CE and PE option symbols during trading strategy execution. Despite multiple attempts to fix the unsubscribe functionality, the issue persisted.

## Solution
Instead of relying on the WebSocket unsubscribe method, we implemented a new approach using a dedicated WebSocket Data Manager that:

1. Stores all WebSocket data in a centralized dataframe
2. Tracks data for both CE and PE symbols simultaneously
3. Uses the symbol name as a key to prevent mixups
4. Provides thread-safe access to the latest price data
5. Handles data health monitoring and age tracking

## Implementation Details

### New Components

1. **WebSocket Data Manager (`src/websocket_data_manager.py`)**
   - Maintains a thread-safe dataframe of all symbol prices
   - Handles data updates from WebSocket callbacks
   - Provides clean API for retrieving LTP data
   - Tracks data freshness and performs health checks

2. **Modified Strategy Implementation**
   - Updated `monitor_for_breakout()` to use the data manager
   - Updated `continuous_position_monitor()` to prioritize data from the manager
   - Improved error handling and logging for data source identification

3. **Integration with Existing Code**
   - The WebSocket callback handlers now update both the data manager and the legacy `live_prices` dictionary
   - Trade execution continues to work with the same logic, but uses more reliable data sources

## Benefits

1. **Resilience**: Even if the WebSocket unsubscribe method fails, the system can still properly identify which symbol triggered a breakout
2. **Consistency**: All price data is stored in a structured dataframe with consistent access patterns
3. **Debugging**: Enhanced logging shows the source of price data (data manager vs. legacy sources)
4. **Safety**: Thread-safe implementation prevents race conditions when updating price data

## Usage

The solution is automatically integrated into the strategy execution. No manual intervention is required.

When a breakout occurs, the system will:
1. Record the symbol that triggered the breakout
2. Execute the trade for that symbol
3. Continue monitoring only that symbol's data from the dataframe
4. Ignore price updates from other symbols without needing to unsubscribe

## Future Improvements

1. Add more sophisticated data validation and anomaly detection
2. Implement automatic recovery for stale data
3. Add visualization of real-time price streams for monitoring
