# WebSocket Price Updates - Diagnostic Report

## Overview
This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the WebSocket price updates in the trading system.

## Current Status
Based on our investigation, we have made several improvements to the WebSocket handling, but have encountered challenges in running tests to verify if real-time price updates are now working correctly.

## Key Findings

1. **WebSocket Implementation**: 
   - The WebSocket functionality is implemented in `src/fyers_api_utils.py` using the `robust_market_data_websocket` function
   - Price updates are handled through callback functions that update `live_prices` dictionary

2. **Enhanced WebSocket Handling**:
   - Added fallback mechanisms to use previous close prices when LTP is not available
   - Improved logging to clearly indicate when market is closed
   - Better handling of null/missing data in ticks dictionary
   - Added market status detection utility in `market_utils.py`

3. **Testing Challenges**:
   - We've encountered difficulties running the test scripts due to:
     - Syntax errors in `strategy.py` that need to be resolved
     - Challenges with terminal output display in the current environment
     - Potential issues with the market being closed during test runs

## Recommendations

1. **Strategy.py Repairs**:
   - Fix all syntax and indentation errors in `strategy.py` (multiple instances of broken indentation found)
   - Consider a complete review of the file structure to ensure proper code organization

2. **Testing Approach**:
   - Use log files instead of console output for debugging
   - Create a simple, standalone WebSocket client that just connects and logs price updates
   - Add explicit timestamps to each price update to verify frequency and timing
   - Run tests during market hours to guarantee data flow

3. **WebSocket Diagnostics**:
   - Implement a "heartbeat" system that periodically logs status even if no price updates are received
   - Add connectivity checks to verify the WebSocket connection remains active
   - Log WebSocket reconnection attempts and connection status changes

## Current Execution Path

```
1. WebSocket client connects via start_market_data_websocket()
2. Incoming data flows through the callback handler
3. Price updates are processed through ws_breakout_handler()
4. Live prices are stored in the strategy's live_prices dictionary
```

## Next Steps

1. Fix syntax errors in `strategy.py`
2. Run a simplified WebSocket test during market hours 
3. Verify price updates are being received with different values
4. Monitor connection stability over time

This diagnostic report indicates we've made significant improvements to the WebSocket handling code, but final verification requires running tests during market hours when prices are actively changing.
